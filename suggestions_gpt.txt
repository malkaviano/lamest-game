Interactivity Suggestions (GPT)

1) Structured Combat UI [DONE]
- Emit structured combat events from `GameLoopService` (actorId, targetId, effectType, amount, hit/miss, crit, dodge).
- Use these to drive UI without parsing logs. Add a `CombatFeedService` to fan-out events to animations, sounds, and UI badges.

- Add HP/EP/AP mini-bars to each interactive card (top-right overlay). [DONE]
- Show status effect chips (e.g., Burning, Poisoned) with timers; fade when expired.
- Display cooldown badges for actions that a target imposes (e.g., engagement timer) with countdown.

4) Targeted Animations
- Expand floating numbers: offset and color per subtype are in place; add critical hit variant (bigger, shake, flash).
- Apply subtle hit flash on the target card (border glow by effect type; short pulse via CSS/GSAP).
- Miss/Dodge animations: slide “Miss” or “Dodge” text over target, faint swoosh sound.

5) Audio Feedback
- Map `EffectTypeLiteral` to specific sounds (fire sizzle, acid hiss, kinetic thud, sacred chime, profane distortion).
- Add cooldown/deny beeps for invalid actions; success/level-up fanfare.

7) Input Micro-interactions
- Hovering an interactive card could reveal quick actions as floating icon buttons.
- Keyboard shortcuts: cycle targets, confirm last action, quick use of a bound skill.

8) Scene Visual Feedback
- When an action involves the current scene (e.g., opening a door), briefly animate the scene image (shake/open overlay) and show a small floating label near it.

9) Accessibility & Clarity
- Add ARIA labels to action buttons and status chips. [PARTIAL]
- Offer a colorblind-friendly palette for damage types; allow toggling high-contrast mode.

10) Performance Considerations
- Use `OnPush` for display-only components (cards, chips, bars).
- Batch animations where possible; limit simultaneous GSAP timelines to prevent jank under heavy combat.

Implementation Sketches
- Add `CombatEvent` interface and `combatEvents$` in `GameLoopService`. [DONE]
- Create `combat-feed.service.ts` to subscribe to `combatEvents$` and trigger: [DONE]
  - `FloatingNumbersService.showDamage(..)` with precise anchors. [DONE]
  - `SoundService.playEffect(effectType)`. [PARTIAL]
  - `HighlightService.flashCard(targetId, effectType)`. [DONE]
- Extend `InteractiveWidgetComponent` to accept live stats (HP/EP/AP snapshot) and effects, rendering mini-bars and chips. [PARTIAL]
- Introduce `cooldown-badge` and `status-chip` small components for reuse. [PARTIAL]

Small Quick Wins [DONE]
- Add miss/dodge floating texts immediately by detecting `MISSED` / dodge messages. [DONE]
- Animate the interactive card border on affect: a quick `gsap.to` pulse. [DONE]
- Add AP cost pills to action buttons using existing settings store. [DONE]
