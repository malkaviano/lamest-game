Interactivity Suggestions (GPT)

4) Targeted Animations
- Expand floating numbers: offset and color per subtype are in place;
 add critical hit variant (bigger, shake, flash).
- Apply subtle hit flash on the target card (border glow by effect type; short pulse via CSS/GSAP).
- Miss/Dodge animations: slide “Miss” or “Dodge” text over target, faint swoosh sound.

5) Audio Feedback
- Map `EffectTypeLiteral` to specific sounds (fire sizzle, acid hiss, kinetic thud, sacred chime,
 profane distortion).
- Add cooldown/deny beeps for invalid actions; success/level-up fanfare.

7) Input Micro-interactions
- Hovering an interactive card could reveal quick actions as floating icon buttons.
- Keyboard shortcuts: cycle targets, confirm last action, quick use of a bound skill.

8) Scene Visual Feedback
- When an action involves the current scene (e.g., opening a door),
 briefly animate the scene image (shake/open overlay) and show a small floating label near it.

9) Accessibility & Clarity
- Add ARIA labels to action buttons and status chips. [PARTIAL]
- Offer a colorblind-friendly palette for damage types; allow toggling high-contrast mode.

10) Performance Considerations
- Use `OnPush` for display-only components (cards, chips, bars).
- Batch animations where possible; limit simultaneous GSAP timelines to prevent jank under heavy combat.
