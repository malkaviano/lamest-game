## About
~~Scenario descriptions were generated using ChatGPT~~

Texts were replaced by AI generated images.

This project was started as an exercise about agile mentality, MVP and XP principles, the game engine was an accident the initial thought was to produce a simple web text game.

Angular framework was pushed and used in some cases ignoring the best practices or conventions to keep all the code into the app. Maybe in the future a server will be created.

Most of the code is tested, but after a while the discipline started to fail, some refactoring is also in need.

This is a work in progress, but not a priority right now, PRs are welcome.
