Texts were removed and AI images are now used

This project was started as an exercise about agile mentality, MVP and XP principles, the game engine was an accident the initial thought was to produce a simple web text game.

Angular framework was pushed and used in some cases without the best practices to keep all the code into the app. Maybe in the future a server will be created.

Most of the code is testes, but after a while the discipline started to fail, some refactoring is also in need.

This is a work in progress, but not a priority right now, PRs are welcome.
